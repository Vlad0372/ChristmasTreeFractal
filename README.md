# ChristmasTreeFractal
The Winform application is just a wrapper for displaying the calculations done in a library written in assemby.

The library (all calculations come from) was written fully in assembly and imported to a C# Winform application which generally
only sets start values for some variables and then passes them to the library. The lib does all the calculations and returns points the winform app should draw.

This example uses a christmas tree set of start values.
